## Natas
Natas is a wargame hosted by OverTheWire. It is a beginner level wargame and is a great way to get started with web application security. The goal of the game is to find the password for the next level, which is stored in /etc/natas_webpass/natasX, where X is the level number. The password for level X+1 is in the file /etc/natas_webpass/natasX+1 and so on.
